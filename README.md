# Monika Komsta – Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hi, I’m Monika! I am an experienced technical professional with 7+ years of industry experience and a strong background in engineering, analysis, and problem-solving. My career began in the electronics industry, where I worked as a Component Engineer specializing in sourcing electronic components, managing EDA libraries, and performing lifecycle and compliance analysis. Throughout my work, I developed a solid understanding of electronic device construction, technical documentation, and supply chain dynamics.

In this role, I gained strong skills in analysing PCB projects, identifying and resolving design issues, and preparing clear, structured technical reports and presentations for cross-functional teams. I also worked extensively with large datasets related to electronic components, which strengthened my analytical mindset and ultimately sparked my interest in data-driven decision-making.

I recently completed a Junior Data Analyst training program and earned a certificate, gaining practical experience in SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy), Power BI, and Excel. This allowed me to expand my analytical skill set and transition my engineering problem-solving mindset into the world of data. I am eager to apply my attention to detail, structured thinking, and analytical approach to uncover insights, improve processes, and support data-driven decision-making.

I enjoy working with data, exploring new tools, and continuously developing my skills. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I am motivated by the challenge of transforming complex information into meaningful conclusions and actionable insights.
